## Overview

**Factor models** are financial tools that help investors identify and manage investment characteristics that 
influence the risks and returns of stocks and portfolios. 
While the mathematics of factor models may be unfamiliar to some, 
the underlying concepts are straightforward. Factor models help investors classify and estimate equity risk and assess the relationships between securities and returns to help guide investment decisions. The models are commonly used to construct portfolios by targeting specific dimensions and to attribute investment performance across multiple factor characteristics.
